# Fixing a challenge with the teacher workflow

Below is a fake challenge that has a typo. The source code of the HTML file also has an error. But to test that the fix works, we need to work on that file locally.

## Create a profile page with HTML

### Release 1

Use heading, paragraph, image and anchor elements to create a profile for yourself in HTML. There is a template `index.html` file provided in this repo. You can edit or delete the contents in it and replace it with your own.

### Release 2

Wrap some of your content in div elements and style your content in the default.css file. All of your content should be centered on a panel that is a different color than the background.
